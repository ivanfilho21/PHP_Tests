# CRUD MySQL
> A simple CRUD and Registration/Login website with PHP and MySQL.

### What is working:
* User registration/sign up (it adds a new user in database).
* User login/sign in (it checks if username and password exist in database).
* Index page, showing the list of tables from the database.
* Creating Tables.

### What I'm working on:
* Index page (listing tables, deleting tables).
* View-table page (list, insert, and delete records of a table).

### Things I'm learning:
* Super global variables $_GET, $_POST, and $_SESSION.
* Global variables.
* SQL basic commands.

### Still in development.
