# CRUD MySQL
> A simple CRUD and Registration/Login website with PHP and MySQL.

### What is working:
* User registration/sign up (it adds a new user in database).
* User login/sign in (it checks if username and password exist in database).

### What am I working on:
* Index page (Should be shown only when the user is signed up).

### Things I am learning:
* Super global variable $_POST.
* global variables.
* Inserting data into MySQL Database (insert command).
* Retrieving data from MySQL Database (select command).

### Still in development.
